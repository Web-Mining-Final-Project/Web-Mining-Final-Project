We used Spam or Not Spam Dataset to create several models and compare their
accuracies finding whether an email is spam or not. In conclusion, the performance
evaluation of various classification algorithms on a spam detection project reveals
significant differences in accuracy. Naive Bayes achieved the highest accuracy of 98.99%,
making it a promising choice for accurately classifying spam and non-spam emails.
Random Forest also performed impressively well, with an accuracy of 96.57%,
showcasing its ability to effectively classify spam emails. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
and Decision Tree learning achieved accuracies of 92.83% and 91.52% respectively,
indicating their potential as viable options for spam detection. However, the K-Nearest
Neighbors algorithm had a lower accuracy of 89.70%, suggesting that it may not be as
suitable for this particular project. Overall, Naive Bayes and Random Forest demonstrate
the highest effectiveness in accurately classifying spam emails, and further
experimentation or fine-tuning may be required to improve the performance of the
other algorithms.
